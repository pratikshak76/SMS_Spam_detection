SMS spam detection is a machine learning application aimed at identifying and filtering spam messages from legitimate ones. The project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess and analyze textual data from SMS messages and uses classification algorithms to predict whether a message is spam or not.

Key Features:
Data Collection:

A dataset of SMS messages (e.g., the popular SMS Spam Collection dataset) containing labeled examples of spam and non-spam (ham) messages.
Data Preprocessing:

Text Cleaning: Removing unwanted characters, numbers, and special symbols.
Tokenization: Breaking down messages into individual words or tokens.
Stopword Removal: Eliminating common words like "is," "and," "the" that don't contribute to spam detection.
Stemming/Lemmatization: Reducing words to their base forms for uniformity.
Feature Extraction:

Bag of Words (BoW): Converting text into a numerical format based on word frequency.
TF-IDF: Weighing words by their importance in the dataset.
Word Embeddings: Using advanced methods like Word2Vec or GloVe for semantic understanding.
Model Building:

Training machine learning models like Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, or deep learning models such as LSTMs or transformers.
Evaluating models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Spam Detection:

The model predicts whether a given SMS message is spam or ham based on its features.
Deployment:

Integrating the model into an application (e.g., a web or mobile app) for real-time spam detection.
Applications:
Filtering SMS S
